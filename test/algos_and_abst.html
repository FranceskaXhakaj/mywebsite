                        <p>Solution: Algorithms are procedures that specify the steps one needs to take to complete a task or solve a problem. They are used to standardize processes and communicate them between different people. Some examples of algorithms include recipes, tax codes, and sewing patterns.</p>

                        <p>Solution: Abstraction is a technique used to make complex systems manageable by changing the amount of detail used to represent or interact with the system. Examples include credit cards, debit cards, cash, coins, venmo, etc. which are ways to abstract money.
